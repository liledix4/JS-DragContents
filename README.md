# JS-DragContents

JavaScript library for dragging elements. Initially [a snippet by Ionut Daniel (thenutz)](https://codepen.io/thenutz/pen/VwYeYEE), it's modified into a module for broader use.

Mouse and touch input are supported!

## Usage

Three easy actions!

1. Import module into your script!

    ```js
    import { dragContents } from "./modules/drag-contents.js";
    ```

    Directory may be different, depending on your file structure.

2. Add this attribute to any scrollable HTML tag: `drag-contents`

3. Run `dragContents()` in any of your JS scripts!

Now watch your elements being moved when you drag them!
